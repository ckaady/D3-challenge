## Correlations Between Poverty, Lack of Healthcare, and Obesity

Data was sourced from the US census. I looked at the relationship between poverty vs. obesity and poverty vs. lack of healthcare in each state.

Looking first at the relationship between poverty and obesity. There appears to be a correlation between poverty and obesity. In this case, the highest poverty states are also at the top of the obesity scale.

I also examined the relationship of poverty to lack of healthcare. There seems to be a correlation between the two, as the states with the highest poverty rates also show to have a greater lack of healthcare.
